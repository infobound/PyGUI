# PyGUI

After looking for a good Python GUI WYSIWYG I decided to write my own.  This is an attempt to create a more robust and stable option.  

The purpose is to be open and extendable.  All setting are in plain text files in JSON format and the save format is also JOSN so it can be loaded directly into your own Python project or to create a class generater.

This is currently in alpha development, please be kind ;)
